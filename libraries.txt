## we can install all required libraries with:
pip install -U langchain langchain-community sentence-transformers pinecone-client==3.0.0 transformers
we're running this on Google Colab, the google.colab module is already available by default.

let us discuss each library
1.langchain
Core library for building LLM pipelines like RetrievalQA

2.langchain-community
Provides integrations for document loaders, vectorstores, and embeddings

3.sentence-transformers:
Used to convert text chunks into embeddings (vectors) using pretrained models

4.pinecone-client==3.0.0
Python SDK to connect and interact with Pinecone vector database

5.transformers
HuggingFace's library for loading and running pretrained models like FLAN-T5

6.os
To manage environment variables (API keys) securely

7.google.colab
(Used in Colab) to upload files from your local system to the notebook

8.huggingface_hub (internal via transformers)
To download models from HuggingFace model hub
